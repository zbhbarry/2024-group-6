## Snake
For snake we have short listed this classic game for many reasons. The top reasons that we picked this game were for its multitude of options and possibilities to be extended with new exciting inovative software devlopment features. As a group, we have highlighted the opportunity to extend Snake with features such as 2 player game play, added walls and eating smaller snakes. Each one of these features will give us, as a group, plenty to work on. The Two Player feature will enable two users on the same machine to play the same game. While adding walls will make it much harder for the snake to move around and access the much needed nutrients need for game play. To offset this we will include smaller snakes to increase the ability for the snake to increase in size.

Following creating a prototype for Snake, we quickly found many positives and negative associated though carrying out our development process. This included a change of name, good demonstration and not much in the way of a need to change the core elements of our design. Feedback quickly prompted us to change the name of the game to Snake Wars as the original was too similar to other games out there.  

## Flappy Bird
Choosing Flappy Bird as our inspiration brings a delightful challenge to the table. Our concept introduces several innovative features: Firstly, we can incorporate new patterns that allow players to navigate through pipes to reach new locations or maps. Secondly, we aim to enhance the bird's abilities through unique means, e.g. the ability to shoot lasers. Lastly, we propose adding new gates that redirect players to the starting point, elevating the difficulty level of the game.

*Right-click and select "Open link in new tab" to watch the video without leaving GitHub.*

We have ultimately chosen to base our game idea on Flappy Bird and transform it into "Super Spaceman" (the name may be subject to change). As demonstrated in the prototype above, we have primarily introduced three new features: the inclusion of game props, such as heart items to increase lives and a prop gun to destroy debuff effects; alongside these, the addition of negative buffs (such as signs that immediately return the player to the starting point upon collision and signs that alter gravity) constitutes another new feature; the final feature allows players to access another map through special new channels or to complete the game by traversing obstacles.

## Game Selection - Why we have chosen Super Spaceman

Although both games hold exciting potential, there was definitely a clear favourite throughout the research process, and the group has collectively agreed to pursue Super Spaceman. Ultimately, Super Spaceman has a greater scope for game features and creative opportunities. For Snake, we could not think of many challenges other than implementing walls, where as, for SSM, we were able to think of multiple categories, including various different hazards and power ups. So much, that we have had to spend time narrowing down which of our ideas to use. When researching these features, we concluded that SSM will also be more complex to implement, therefore providing us a greater chance to apply our knowledge and skills. Similarly, we feel more excited about the interface for SSM, and have already thought of different game maps. Our thoughts were confirmed in Mondayâ€™s lab, where we received positive feedback for SSM, and there was a general consensus that this was a more innovative idea and would be the most popular game.
